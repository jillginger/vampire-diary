1. Researched using CAT on REDCap
2. Browsed scoring mannual and official website of PROMIS, figured out that REDCap CAT must use their API /App
3. Emailed on April 26th to ask the price for the API (annual subscription). no reply yet.
4. Downloaded the PROMIS app on my own iPad. Can't connect to REDCap. Can export. Subscription fee is $699.99/ year
5. Emailed back the Health Measures for the pricing of their API (their previous email did not include the pricing)
6. Emailed CRU to ask what I can do on REDCap to add the computerized adaptive instruments (API).
