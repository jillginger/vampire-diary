1. Had a meeting with Dr. Tweedie about potential cordination in the CAT project
2. Reviewed the data dictionary ready Trafford fixed for family history, and finished the do file to update the Epic info to REDCap

1. upload data dictionary to REDCap - types does not allow "paragraph", so I deleted it.
2. Errors still occurred after deleting "paragraph". It turned out that there were some format existing even the cells looked empty. Errors fixed by copying real empty cells and pasted on the cells that used to have "paragraph".
3. Data dictionary was successfully uploaded.
4. The changes of the data dictionary were not in effect. I found it out because there were some issues with the EPIC questionnaire, and I fixed it, but when I uploaded more information about
EPIC, there occurred errors.

Welcome back from Labor Day!
1. checked if data dictionary is taken effect - no. (9:46 am)
2. Added "su_004" to the dataset I last sent to Henry and sent it to Henry.
3. Fixed EPIC22-EPIC26 values for the "hand corrected" observations based on the new, correct data dictionary. For these variables, the value labels used to be 1-4 indicating no problem to big problem. Fixed them as 1-4.

1. Uploaded all updated data of RAC5 to REDCap.
Issued: the .dta file downloded seemed to shift the value to the left by one cell, on the right of certain variables. Dunno why it happened because it's generated automatically
by running the do file I got from REDCap. Fixed the issue by exporting a csv dataset from REDCap then copied and pasted to STATA.

1. Double checked the updated dataset.
Details: Exported the updated dataset to local, then compare it to the local dataset.
Issues: 1. used Python df1!=df2.sum(), showed numerous unequal data. However, when I opened the two csv respectively, the data value that shown different on the Python notebook
seemed to be equal.
